# ing-to-ynab-converter
Converts the .txt file you get from the ING site to a .csv file YNAB4 can read.

# Usage
Run the program once, and edit the .ini file with your own IBAN.
Then, simply drag and drop your bankstatement onto the program and it will produce a file called 'output.csv', usable by YNAB.
